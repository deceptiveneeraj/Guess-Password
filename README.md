# 🔐 Password Guesser (Brute Force Simulator)

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates a brute-force password guessing algorithm. It randomly guesses each character of a user-entered password until the correct password is found.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This script is purely for educational and entertainment purposes. Brute-force attacks are illegal and unethical when used maliciously.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The user enters a password (only lowercase letters are supported).

- It continues guessing until it matches the entire password.
